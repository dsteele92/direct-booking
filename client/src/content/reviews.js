		review: 'Brenson’s place is absolutely PERFECT! We came to Portland to celebrate New Years with our close friends and kiddos. The house is located in the heart of Portland and is close to everything. The house looks just like the photos and is very clean. Thank you for such a great experience Brenson!',

		review: 'We enjoyed our stay! Great space, location and neighborhood! Brenson (owner) & Thomas (reservation handler) were great! So much in fact, Brenson personally saw to ensuring we had everything we needed, and asked how our stay was going throughout it. Would definitely stay here again next time we’re in Portland!',

		review: 'The listing is just as pictured. Pillows were comfy. It had a cool Pac-Man arcade type game. Kitchen is stocked well and has a lot of spices and tea/coffee. It’s a short walk to mt tabor and a longer walk to restaurants which our group didn’t mind. Host is very responsive, which we really appreciated! It’s a pretty quiet street but it does get more traffic. Neighbors are nice. Just a heads up, whenever the heater kicks on it makes a noise which only one bedroom could really hear, the middle one upstairs. It’s not terrible, just worth mentioning. Don’t put your light sleeper in the middle bedroom. :)',

		review: 'We loved the location. It was close to Mt Tabor which is a wonderful walk for families and people of all ages. Also has a small field nearby for frisbees. The place was well stocked with plates, silverware, and knives for cooking a big meal. The host was easy to communicate with and took care of any questions or concerns.',

		review: 'Brenson was a fantastic host! He was very responsive & helpful during my stay. I can tell he takes pride in the place and guest experience. I came into Portland for a work trip & could not be happier with my stay. The house was clean, well equipped & very comfortable! The location was perfect for me as I had meetings in different parts of Portland during my stay. I was also able to find amazing restaurants using his guidebook which was good with the number of options in the area. I stayed at the house by myself, but it seems like it would be perfect for a larger group! I’ll definitely be re-booking with Brenson in the future',

Awesome location in Portland/Mt Tabor. Brenson is an excellent and friendly host! He was very responsive during our stay and helped out with all our questions. He even has an amazing guidebook that has a ton of great food/travel recommendations. I would stay anytime again!',
